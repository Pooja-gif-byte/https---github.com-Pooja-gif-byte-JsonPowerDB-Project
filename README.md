# Session-Management-form based on Project using JsonPowerDB
Session Management is a mechanism used by the Web container to store session information for a particular user.
For eg. When a User logs into the website, no matter on which web page he visits after logging in, his credentials will be saved with the server, until he logs out. So this is managed by creating a session.

We will learn Session Management through HR-Dashboard Problem by creating logged-in and logged-out pages.
